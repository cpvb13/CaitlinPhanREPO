    "I found it amusing how the writer contradicted himself every other step. For example, step one and two are literally oopposites. To copy-paste code is practical, but don’t copy paste code also makes sense. This shows there is not one \"right\" way to write an ideal code. It is a matter of trial and error, therefore you may be trying out completely different strategies. The author elaborated on \"Step 6: Break your code into pieces\" and accurately described how a programmer's goal should be to write with modules to make the bits of code easier to change or delete. This emphasizes the nature of software to constantly be improved. A code should not be something set in stone, because modifications are part of the learning and building process when it comes to coding. "

    "The following figure depicts Galton's box, a game in which marbles are dropped through N rows of pins.  In row 0, there is one position a marble can be in (labeled 0), in row 1, there are two positions (labeled 0 and 1), and so forth.  Each time the marble bounces from one row to the next, there is a 50% probability it bounces left and a 50% probability it bounces right.\n",

    "\n",

    "- ```insert_marble``` - This method should accept a Marble instance and sets its position to position 0, row 0.\n",
    "- ```time_step``` - This method should cause all Marbles in Galton's box to bounce to the next row, dropping left or right with equal probability.  When a marble reaches row N-1 at the bottom of the box, it should not move any more.  Note that you should simply allow marbles to occupy the same position (instead of working out a system to prevent a Marble from entering a position if another Marble is already there).\n",
